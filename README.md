# First-Project

This is our first group project.

Description: Recollect data of plant growing, soil status and weather events from local farmers and growers to build a database.

## Viability analysis: 

  ###   Executive Summary:
  
    We want to create a platform where, mostly, farmers, share their information about the evolutions of their crops
    and the cares they give them to help others famers improve the quality of their crops and advise them for any
    plague that affect to the crops.

  ### Description of Products and Services:
  
    Products: Our product is an Android and web application with a database to store the data obtained from the
    sensors that monitorize the vitamins and health of our users’ plants.
    Services: Full access to a database with information about the treatment of a plant and its impact on the plant’s
    health.

  ### Technology Considerations: 
  
    The frontend of our web application is going to be developed with Polymer and CSS, it’s going to be hosted in
    Firebase, also used for the database. This can be used for the mobile application.
    An embedded system with a couple of sensors is going to be used as the device that collects all the data.

  ### Product/Service Marketplace:
  
    It will be focused to the local farmers that want full control and data of their plants and important
    meteorologic events that can be harmful to their crops.
